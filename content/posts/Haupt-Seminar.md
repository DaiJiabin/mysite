## Some Definitions

### Network Edge

- Where devices or local network interfaces with Internet

### Fog/Edge/Mobile-Edge Computing

- Fog/Edge Computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings data storage and computation closer to where it is needed to improve the response time and save bandwidth.

- Mobile Edge Computing is a network archietecture which enables the cloud computing capabilities and IT services at the edge of the network.

### Software-Defined-Network

- Features:

  - Decoupling the data plane and control plane

- Advantages:

  - Get a global overview of the network from data plane

- Components:

  - SDN controller
    - Gather the entire behaviors of network, orchestration & resource management
  - SDN-based edge server
    - Provide computation and storage for vehicles, store regional road information, provide emergency service
  - SDN micro based station
    - Running OpenFlow, delivering edge services
  - SDN-base road side units
    - Running OpenFlow, exchange data with vehicles
  - SDN-based smart vehicle
    - On-Board Unit and OpenFlow, end user

- Issues:
  - Security
  - Scalability
  - Elasticity

### Network-Function-Virtualization

- Features:
  - With the help of IT virtualization technology, virtualize the entire classes of network node functions into building blocks that may connect, or chain together, to create communication services.
