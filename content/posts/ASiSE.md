## 03. ADED

### What is ADED

- __A__ nalyse
  - _role: existing technologies, backgrounds, problems_
- __D__ esign
  - _role: new technologies_
- __E__ valuate
  - necessary for technical papers
  - a technical thesis must be technical( achieve and demonstrate a technical result )
  - success factors have to be analyzed to know whether a result is really needed
  - _role: show why the new solution is superior; use_ __success cretiria__
- __D__ iffuse
  - by writing: a design pattern, a report by demonstrating a software prototype
  - _role: popularize the research results; demonstration for creating vision_

### Tasks for each

| Analyse | Design | Evaluate(Role?) | Diffuse |
| :-----: | :----: | :------: | :-----: |
|problem analysis;<br>automation or optimization hypothesis;<br>success factor analysis|requirements of the solution;<br>solution design;<br>design alternatives, assessment and selection;<br>architecture development|testing the research hypothesis by experiments;<br>benchmarking;<br>interpretation of the experiments;<br>documenting the limits of the technology|structuring;<br>drafting;<br>revision;<br>diffuse|

### __AD-R-DE__ for techinical science thesis

- __R__ here represents __"Realize"__

- __For technical science ( in particular SE ), a realization phase is required.__

- Tasks for __realization phase__
  
  - realize the architecture
  
  - tune the system
  
  - stabilize the system for better quality

- Other variants see slides.

## Standard Structure of a technical science thesis

- Show clearly, which part is from you and which part is not(background).

- __Main part is divided in technology and evaluation part__

- Structure see below:

    ![Structure of technical science thesis](/Structure-of-technical-science-thesis.png)

- The structure of a scientific thesis is related to the chapters, __write chapter by chapter__

    1. Start with _background_ and _literature/state of art_ chapters from the orientation phase
    2. Develop technical solution and write it up in a main techinical contribution chapter
    3. Validate with an evaluation in parallel
    4. repeat

## Analysis

### Orientation analysis and idea generation

#### Semantic Nets (simple concept maps)

- A semantic net draws objects and their relationships and action in a graph

- distinguished relationships: __is-a, has-a, owns-a__

![semantic_map](/semantic_map.png)

#### Concept Maps

- Shows several concepts and their relations. Usually, one starts with several central concepts in the middle of a page and collects associasions. See below:

    ![concept-maps](/concept-maps.png)

- __Concept Maps is a method for analysis, idea generation and structuring__

- __A concept map is a model of problems, knowledges, goals, solution ideas__

- Enriches semantic nets with pictures and figures

#### Clustering

- Helps to develop hierarchic, logical structures

- A __node-labeled concept map__ with one root in the middle of the page

- Called a mindmap if the cluster is a tree

#### Mindmaps

- A node- or edge-labeled association tree

#### Line/Row Hierarchy (Q-A-Hierarchy)

- From a mindmap or structure tree, a row hierarchy can be formed with main thesis and arguments

- Phrase the main point as a question, and let the arguments answer the question

    ![QA-Hierachy](/QA-Hierachy.png)

### Problem analysis with questions

#### The honset serving men, 7 basic questions

- who; what; how; where; when; why; for what/to which end

    ![7-w](/7-w.png)

- Integrate into idea generation techniques:

  - Analyze problems: "why" and "which end"
  
  - Generate solution ideas: "how to achieve"
  
  - Structure the available knowledge and literature: "what do we know"

## 04. information gathering

### 4.1 Data, information, knowledge aquisition in science

#### What is DIKW model

- __D__ ata

- __I__ nformation

- __K__ nowledge

- __W__ isdom

![DIKW](/DIKW.png)

- Above are what __science about__

- <u>Natural</u> science: _find data and interprete them into knowledge_

- <u>Technical</u> science: _use knowledge to solve problems,_ __but need to be wise__(i.e., nuclear energy ).

#### The knowledge aquisition model from spinner

- Knowledge is __context-dependent__ and comes from __information by interpretation__

- Answering questions creates knowledge.

- __Knowledge is what remains after answering questions__

![knowledge-aquisi](/knowledge-aquisi.png)

#### Typical questions for interpretation

- About sender

- About context

- About receiver

### 4.2 __Reading process__ with RIK

#### What is RIK

- __R__ elevance check

- __I__ nformation

- __K__ nowledge aquisition

![RIK](/RIK.png)

- Stopping all the way and not wasting time

- Structured along the DIKW pyramid and the spinner IK aquisition process

#### 4.2.1 Relevance check

##### Classify papers(Fong)

- Relevant research
- High innovation depth
- Narrow result
- Disruptive result
- Epsilon-result
- "low hanging fruit"-result

##### SWOT analysis

- 4-dimensional attribute analysis for the _development of a strategy for a project_

- For _strategic decisions of thesis and research_

![SWOT](/SWOT.png)

- Try to combine with "6-honest-men"

##### Killer App analysis

- Investigates for _a product or a research paper_, whether it's needed, it's comprehensive

![killer-app](/killer-app.png)

- __Attractive-Product__ $=$ Need $\times$ Comprehensibility

#### 4.2.2 Information aquisition

##### Questions

- Overview about preexisting knowledge
- Formulate questions before reading

##### Reading

- Work systematically through the text
- Mark up central terms and paragraphs
- Formulate questions while reading
- Record ideas
- Structure ideas by a semantic net or concept map

##### Grouping in semantic nets and concept maps

- Operations, that create knowledge from information:

  Grouping, hieraichizing, re-drawing, dualizing.

##### House concept map

#### 4.2.3 Knowledge aquisition

##### Recite

- Embed new information into old knowledge
- Write summary: pose and answer questions
- Talk
- Repeat information acquisition in details, per section
- Relation to own previous work

### 4.3 Other reading methods

### 4.4 Methods to recite for knowledge acquisition

#### How to recite and summarize

##### Recite

- Personalize the information
- Learn actively by reformulation
- Abstract from unneccessary details
- Easy way to find focused information again

##### Summary

- Underlining
- Margin notes
- Excerpting
- Mindmapping
- Structure Trees
- Cracking Sentences

### 4.5 Information gathering

### 4.6 Writing literature analysis papers

#### Use cases

- Standalone for overview journals.

- Background chapter for thesis

#### 1-3-1 structure of literature analysis paragraphs

- Thesis statement
  
  - Requirements background
  
  - Taxonomy
  
  - Research landscape

- Message sentence
