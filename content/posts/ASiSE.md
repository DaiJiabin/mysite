## What is ADED

- __A__ nalyse
  - _rol3: existing technologies, backgrounds, problems_
- __D__ esign
  - _rol3: new technologies_
- __E__ valuate
  - necessary for technical papers
  - a technical thesis must be technical( achieve and demonstrate a technical result )
  - success factors have to be analyzed to know whether a result is really needed
  - _rol3: show why the new solution is superior; use_ __success cretiria__
- __D__ iffuse
  - by writing: a design pattern, a report by demonstrating a software prototype
  - _rol3: popularize the research results; demonstration for creating vision_

### Tasks for each

| Analyse | Design | Evaluate(Role?) | Diffuse |
| :-----: | :----: | :------: | :-----: |
|problem analysis;<br>automation or optimization hypothesis;<br>success factor analysis|requirements of the solution;<br>solution design;<br>design alternatives, assessment and selection;<br>architecture development|testing the research hypothesis by experiments;<br>benchmarking;<br>interpretation of the experiments;<br>documenting the limits of the technology|structuring;<br>drafting;<br>revision;<br>diffuse|

### __AD-R-DE__ for techinical science thesis

- __R__ here represents __"Realize"__

- __For technical science ( in particular SE ), a realization phase is required.__

- Tasks for __realization phase__
  
  - realize the architecture
  
  - tune the system
  
  - stabilize the system for better quality

- Other variants see slides.

## Standard Structure of a technical science thesis

- Show clearly, which part is from you and which part is not(background).

- __Main part is divided in technology and evaluation part__

- Structure see below:

    ![Structure of technical science thesis](/Structure-of-technical-science-thesis.png)

- The structure of a scientific thesis is related to the chapters, __write chapter by chapter__

    1. Start with _background_ and _literature/state of art_ chapters from the orientation phase
    2. Develop technical solution and write it up in a main techinical contribution chapter
    3. Validate with an evaluation in parallel
    4. repeat

## Analysis

### Orientation analysis and idea generation

#### Semantic Nets (simple concept maps)

- A semantic net draws objects and their relationships and action in a graph

- distinguished relationships: __is-a, has-a, owns-a__

![semantic_map](/semantic_map.png)

#### Concept Maps

- Shows several concepts and their relations. Usually, one starts with several central concepts in the middle of a page and collects associasions. See below:

    ![concept-maps](/concept-maps.png)

- __Concept Maps is a method for analysis, idea generation and structuring__

- __A concept map is a model of problems, knowledges, goals, solution ideas__

- Enriches semantic nets with pictures and figures

#### Clustering

- Helps to develop hierarchic, logical structures

- A __node-labeled concept map__ with one root in the middle of the page

- Called a mindmap if the cluster is a tree

#### Mindmaps

- A node- or edge-labeled association tree

#### Line/Row Hierarchy (Q-A-Hierarchy)

- From a mindmap or structure tree, a row hierarchy can be formed with main thesis and arguments

- Phrase the main point as a question, and let the arguments answer the question

### Problem analysis with questions

#### The honset serving men, 7 basic questions

- who; what; how; where; when; why; for what/to which end

    ![7-w](/7-w.png)

- Integrate into idea generation techniques:

  - Analyze problems: "why" and "which end"
  
  - Generate solution ideas: "how to achieve"
  
  - Structure the available knowledge and literature: "what do we know"
