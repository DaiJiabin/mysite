# Spring Notes

## Day 01. Basic Concepts

- Kernel Techs: __IoC(Inversion of Control)__ and __aop.__ Loose the Relationships between Modules.

### IoC ( Inversion of Control )

- Creation, Value-Given and Management belong to the __Containers beyond Codes.__

- Management:
  
  Creation, Attributes-Given and Management of the Relationships of Objects.

- Inversion:

  Transfer the Rights of Management, Creation of Objects  to the Containers ( here: Spring ) beyond Codes.

- WHY IoC:

  We're LAZY. This can make the Management of Objects easier.

- __DI ( Dependency Injection ): Technic Realization__

  Offer the Object's Name only, no need to care how it's created, value given and search, etc. __In Spring, Reflection is used.__
